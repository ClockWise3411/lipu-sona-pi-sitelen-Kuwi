# Using the sitelen Kuwi Font

Thank you for trying out sitelen Kuwi! I’ve decided to make this quick guide on how to use the file because without it you may find yourself lost, unsure how to access certain glyphs or even feeling some things just won’t type how you’d expect.

### Download and First Use

Once you download the font file, which you can find [here](https://github.com/ClockWise3411/sitelen-leko-Kuwi/raw/refs/heads/main/sitelen.Kuwi.otf), install the font. On most systems, this would mean opening the downloaded file and clicking an "install" button. From there, all you need to do is change the font in settings of the software you choose to use it with. Please note that the font file will only be accessible on locally installed software, while online applications such as Google Docs will not support it. 

### How to Type with sitelen Kuwi

Firstly, each glyph is a ligature. All you need to do to access a glyph is type the latin letters of the desired word:
 
Typing `soweli` will yield <span class="kuwi center big">soweli</span>

Please note that autocorrect may interfere with this, especially if there is auto-capitalisation, as `Soweli` will instead render as <span class="kuwi medium">Soweli</span>.

When forming blocks in sitelen Kuwi, do **not** type a space between the two halves of a word. For example, to make one block with "soweli lili", type `sowelilili`:		
<span class="kuwi center big">sowelilili</span>

Typing `soweli lili` will instead separate the block:
<span class="kuwi center big">soweli lili</span>

To get the “empty” block <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>, use a hyphen, e.g. `soweli-`:
<span class="kuwi medium">soweli-</span>

You may find instances where the output is not what you intended, due to the nature of ligatures. For example, "ma ma li lili" may be parsed as "mama lili li", so instead of seeing this:
<span class="kuwi center big">ma_mali_lili-</span>

you might instead see this:
<span class="kuwi center big">mamalilili-</span>

The font is merging the two "ma" glyphs into "mama" and "li lili" is being reinterpreted as "lili li"

This is not an issue that will come up too often but it is almost guaranteed to come up from time to time. To avoid this, you can use an underscore after any glyph to prevent it from merging into the next. In this case, `ma_mali_lili` will yield you with the desired results, as it separates the two "ma"s and the first two "li"s.

As mentioned in the guide, function words like "taso", "en", "anu" can be turned onto their side and used as content words. To achieve this, use a hyphen after the function word. For example, `soweli-taso` renders as:
<span class="kuwi center big">soweli-taso</span>

but `sowelitaso-` renders as:
<span class="kuwi center big">sowelitaso-</span>

The nimi sin function word "n" is the only function word that isn’t accessible by typing normally. Typing `n` normally gives us:
<span class="kuwi center big">n</span> 

To instead write out the function word, add a hyphen after. Typing `n-` yields:
<span class="kuwi center big">n-</span>		

To avoid all ligatures and type only using the phonetic script use all capital letters. For example, `soweli-SOWELI` renders as:
<span class="kuwi center big">soweli-SOWELI</span>

To access the nasalised vowel ligatures when typing in the phonetic script, type a hyphen after the `n`. In other words, `TAN` renders as:
<span class="kuwi center big">TAN</span>

which is essentially "ta" with "n" on the next syllable block. Meanwhile `TAN-`, renders as:
<span class="kuwi center big">TAN-</span>

Thank you for reading my guide!
