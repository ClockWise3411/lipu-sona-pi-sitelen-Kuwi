# What is sitelen Kuwi?

sitelen Kuwi, also refered to by some as sitelen leko, is a script I designed originally for a separate project that happened to work somewhat similarly to toki pona. After putting the project on Hiatus I decided to repurpose the script for toki pona. 

Why would I do this and not just use sitelen pona? Well, unfortunately I’ve never been a huge fan of sitelen pona both functionally and aesthetically. This isn't to say sitelen pona is ugly or doesn't function well, neither of those statements are true, but visually I personally have other preferences. And functionally... Well to understand what I mean you have to understand my goals when adapting this script…

# What were my goals when adapting?

I have always been somewhat dissatisfied with sitelen pona and for many years have struggled to find the source of my dissatisfaction. I tried to develop various other ways to write toki pona in attempts to understand what it is that I wanted from a "native" toki pona script. Eventually I found myself returning to two issues time and time again: Ambiguity and Legibility. but what does this mean?

## Ambiguity

toki pona is naturally an ambiguous language and that is OKAY. I have no problem with this in general, but what if there was a way to eliminate SOME ambiguity without changing the way the language functions at all? What if when reading and writing (the primary ways users consume material for toki pona) there were intuitive visual clues that could terminate some of this ambiguity? Things like determining if a word is acting as a preposition or noun and more easily showing the relationship between different words. This is a question I toyed with in many different ways with many different attempts to create a new writing system.

## Legibility

I consider toki pona to have three major categories for the syntactic role a word can play: Particles, Content words and (what I call) function words. What does this have to do with legibility? Well, let’s take a detour to Japanese and try to understand where I’m coming from. For those of you who have never studied Japanese or don’t know much about the language, it has three writing systems, each with their own function for written communication.
 
#### Kanji  
These are characters borrowed from Chinese which carry semantic meaning.  
Ex. 魚 means fish. This tells us the meaning but not the pronunciation.
#### Hiragana  
A script native to Japan (derived from Kanji) that represents the language phonetically.
Ex. ひらがな. Syllables pronounced **hi.ra.ga.na**
#### Katakana  
Similar in function to Hiragana but different in use.


Along with the functional differences, there are also clear visual differences. Kanji tend to be complex with many straight and angled lines while Hiragana tend to be curvier and quite simple in comparison. Here is an example with Kanji in red and Hiragana in yellow:   
<span class="red">私</span><span class="yellow">は</span><span class="red">食堂</span><span class="yellow">で</span><span class="red"></span><span class="yellow">を</span><span class="red">食</span><span class="yellow">べます</span>.  
Hopefully it is clear how these visual queues can quickly tell the reader where semantic meaning ends and grammar begins.

This is something I wanted to achieve with toki pona as well. I wanted visual queues that could quickly tell the reader what part of toki pona’s grammatical patterns they are looking at. 

## In Summary

sitelen Kuwi is a project I undertook to find a way to better parse both the grammatical function of a word and the relationships between different words using the manner of writing itself. All this while being something I personally find aesthetically pleasing and fun to play with.
