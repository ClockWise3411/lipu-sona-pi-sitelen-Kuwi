# Block Structure
sitelen Kuwi is a block-based system (similar to Korean) with each block containing up to three pieces: 

- two <span class="yellow">semantic halves</span>, and 
- one <span class="red">grammatical marker</span> (i.e. a particle).

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="yellow">li</span><span class="red">00</span></span>

The top half of the block functions as the head and the bottom half as a modifier. For example, "<span class="red">soweli</span> <span class="blue">lili</span>" can be written like this: 

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">soweli</span><span class="blue">lili</span></span>

In toki pona, when a phrase (head + modifiers) contains more than two words, only the first word acts as the head. The same applies to having more than one block in sitelen Kuwi. Only the top half of the first block acts as the head. For example, here's how you would write "<span class="red">soweli</span> <span class="blue">lili suwi mute</span>":

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">soweli</span><span class="blue">lilisuwimute</span></span>

If a phrase contains only one head and no modifiers, we use the special "empty" glyph <span class="kuwi medium">-</span> which carries neither a semantic meaning nor pronunciation. This means that the sentence "<span class="red">soweli</span> li <span class="blue">lili</span>" would look like this:

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">soweli</span>- li_<span class="blue">lili</span>-</span>

Instead of adding the “empty” glyph, the writer can also choose to stretch the primary noun or verb to take up the whole block space. This means that you can write the sentence "<span class="red">soweli</span> li wile ala e <span class="yellow">kili</span>" in two main different ways:

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">soweli</span>- liwileala e<span class="yellow">kili</span>-</span> 

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">animal</span> liwileala e<span class="yellow">plant</span></span>

This method is reserved for handwritten sitelen leko, as the font does not support any standardised version of these stretched glyphs. This means there is plenty of room for creativity when deciding how to stretch. Feel free to add to or change the glyphs in this form as long as it is recognisable.
