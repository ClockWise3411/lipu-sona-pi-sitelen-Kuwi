# Function words:
A function word is a word which carries neither much grammatical nor semantic weight, like ‘en,’ ‘taso,’ and ‘a’. They lie somewhere in between content words and particles, which means they are given their own visual identity, somewhere in between blocks and sticks. For example, here's what the sentence "soweli li wile moku <span class="pink">taso</span> ona li jo ala e moku pona" looks like.

<span class="kuwi big center">soweli- liwilemoku <span class="pink">taso</span> ona- lijoala emokupona</span>

Here is a list of function words: 

| sitelen Lasina | sitelen Kuwi | sitelen Kuwi (horizontal) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| a | <span class="kuwi big center">a</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">a-<span class="gray">-</span></span> |
| anu | <span class="kuwi big center">anu</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">anu-<span class="gray">-</span></span> |
| en | <span class="kuwi big center">en</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">en-<span class="gray">-</span></span> |
| kin | <span class="kuwi big center">kin</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">kin-<span class="gray">-</span></span> |
| taso | <span class="kuwi big center">taso</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">taso-<span class="gray">-</span></span> |
| n | <span class="kuwi big center">n-</span> | <span class="kuwi big center">n--<span class="gray">-</span></span> |

Note that each of these function words also has a horizontal form. This is because function words can also function as modifiers, similarly to content words. The horizontal form is achieved by flipping each glyph on its side. In the sentence "soweli li wile moku <span class="pink">taso</span> ona li jo e kiwen <span class="blue">taso</span>", the word "taso" is used first as a connector, then a modifier, and this is reflected in the orientation of the glyph.

<span class="kuwi big center">soweli- liwilemoku <span class="pink">taso</span> ona- lijo- ekiwen<span class="blue">taso-</span></span>  

I like to replace <span class="kuwi medium">-</span> with "a" just for fun, like this: "nimi ni li pona <span class="blue">a</span>!"

<span class="kuwi center big">nimini lipona<span class="blue">a-</span>!</span>

When being using function words as content words, be wary. <span class="blue">n</span>, <span class="blue">taso</span> and <span class="blue">anu</span> may be misinterpreted as <span class="red">sitelen</span>, <span class="red">wan</span> and <span class="red">uta</span>. The glyphs only differ slightly in that the function words are not connected at the top.

<span class="kuwi center big"><span class="red">sitelen</span><span class="blue">n--</span> <span class="red">wan</span><span class="blue">taso-</span> <span class="red">uta</span><span class="blue">anu-</span></span>
