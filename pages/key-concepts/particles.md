# Particles:
Since particles in toki pona are strictly grammatical in nature with no semantic meaning, they do not have the same visual space as content words. Instead, they are added to the side of the content block, taking up much less space. This can be seen in the sentence "soweli <span class="red">li</span> moku <span class="green">e</span> kili":

<span class="kuwi center big">soweli- <span class="red">li</span>moku- <span class="green">e</span>kili-</span>

Here is a list of all grammatical particles: 

| sitelen Lasina | sitelen Kuwi |
| :-: | :-: |
| li | <span class="kuwi big center">li</span> |
| la | <span class="kuwi big center">la</span> |
| e | <span class="kuwi big center">e</span> |
| pi | <span class="kuwi big center">pi</span> |
| o | <span class="kuwi big center">o</span> |

All particles sit on the left side of the phrase they modify, with the exception of <span class="yellow">la</span>, which sits on the right side. In the sentence, "tenpo pini <span class="yellow">la</span> soweli lili li moku", "<span class="yellow">la</span>" sits on the right of "tenpo pini".
 
<span class="kuwi big center">tenpopini<span class="yellow">la</span> sowelilili limoku-</span>
