# Names and Punctuation

### Names

When you need to write a proper name or any other word outside of toki pona's list of official words, you can use the phonetic script (sitelen kalama) alongside the regular script. 

Sitelen kalama follows the same structure as the rest of sitelen Kuwi, where the blocks are split into two halves. This time, however, the top half usually takes a <span class="red">consonant</span> while the bottom usually takes a <span class="blue">vowel</span>. This is what "ma Kanata" would look like:

<span class="kuwi big center">ma-<span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">A</span><span class="red">N</span><span class="blue">A</span><span class="red">T</span><span class="blue">A</span></span>

For syllables that end in -n, the vowel takes a special nasalised form. "jan <span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">an</span>" thus looks like:

<span class="kuwi big center">jan-<span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">AN-</span></span>

If the first syllable of a word is a vowel with no consonant, the vowel will occupy the top half of the glyph and <span class="kuwi medium">-</span> will occupy the bottom half. For example, the "A" in "ma <span class="blue">A</span>sija" has its own block here:

<span class="kuwi big center">ma-<span class="blue">A</span>-SIJA</span>

If the initial syllable starts with a vowel and ends with an /n/, then the syllable can be written either with a nasalised vowel and <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>, or as a vowel and N glyph. This means "toki <span class="blue">In</span>li" can be written two ways:

<span class="center"><span class="kuwi big">toki-<span class="blue">IN-</span>-LI</span></span>
<span class="center"><span class="kuwi big">toki-<span class="blue">IN</span>LI</span></span>

### Punctuation

Punctuation is pretty straight forward in sitelen Kuwi. There are only four marks which are written at the end of the sentence as expected: ., ?, !, : as well as a set of parentheses ( )

<span class="kuwi big center">. ? ! : ( )</span>

However, when quoting a person, instead of using <span class="kuwi medium">:</span>, you can use two  <span class="kuwi medium">.</span> marks on either side of the quoted phrase. Using this mark as quotes this way is completely optional and more of a stylistic choice. This is how the sentence "ona li toki e ni: mi wile ala e ni" would look with these quotes: 

<span class="kuwi big center">ona- litoki- e_ni- ..mi- wileala e_ni-..</span>

If the quoted phrase were to end in a ? or !, the final <span class="kuwi medium">.</span> at the end of the quote can be replaced with the appropriate mark. Again, this is a stylistic choice and completely optional, but it's how I choose to use the script. Here's an example using "ona li toki e ni: tenpo ni la sina sona a e sitelen Kuwi!"

<span class="kuwi big center">ona- litoki- e_ni- ..tenponila sinasona a esitelenkuwi.!</span>
