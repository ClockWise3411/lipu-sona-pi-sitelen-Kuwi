# Adding More Contras to Toki Pona
A lot of what makes this sitelen special, in my opinion, is the ability to create contrast without changing toki pona grammatically or in any other way. In written toki pona, sometimes, the role content words play in a sentence can be slightly unclear. Spoken speech, on the other hand, comes with more context and the ability to verbally stress certain ideas and ask your conversation partner for more information when you feel you don't understand. So because written communication heavily lacks these important queues, a reader may occasionally be left unsure what the writer had intended to say. The good news is, there is a "solution" to this built right into the structure of sitelen Kuwi.

To exemplify this, imagine you want a person to release an animal of yours that happens to be squirming about. You can say:
> Release my wriggling animal!

Or in toki pona: 
> o pana e soweli tawa mi!

You might have already noticed an issue here. Many speakers might interpret this to mean "give the animal to me," even if that is not what you intended to say. 

Because prepositions can also be interpreted as both predicates, nouns and modifiers, these situations are not rare, and can in fact be a great pain for beginners.

So how does sitelen Kuwi address this? Remember, the bottom half of a block is reserved for modifiers. This means that the sentence "o pana e <span class="red">soweli</span> <span class="blue">tawa</span> mi!" ("Release my <span class="blue">wriggling</span> <span class="red">animal</span>!") would look like this:

<span class="kuwi big center">opana- e<span class="red">soweli</span><span class="blue">tawa</span> mi-</span>

As you can see, "<span class="blue">tawa</span>" is occupying the bottom half of the block, which defines it as an modifier for "<span class="red">soweli</span>", giving us the interpretation “my moving animal.” But what would the more common interpretation look like?

<span class="kuwi big center">opana- e<span class="red">soweli</span>- <span class="blue">tawa</span>- mi-</span>

We can see here there is an intentional separation between <span class="red">soweli</span> and <span class="blue">tawa</span> using <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>. This helps to emphasise that <span class="blue">tawa</span> is working as a preposition and NOT modifying <span class="red">soweli</span>.

### 1st and 2nd Person Pronouns:
Since the pronouns “mi” and “sina” are not directly followed by “li,” this manifests itself in an interesting way in sitelen Kuwi, as this is the only time the bottom half of a block may not necessarily be interpreted as a modifier. Instead, one block alone can constitute a whole clause, like "<span class="red">mi</span> <span class="blue">moku</span>":

<span class="kuwi big center"><span class="red">mi</span><span class="blue">moku</span></span>

However, when the predicate that follows “mi” or “sina” contains a modifier, this predicate phrase should be separated from the pronoun completely using <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>, such as in "<span class="red">mi</span> <span class="blue">soweli ala</span>:

<span class="kuwi big center"><span class="red">mi-</span> <span class="blue">soweliala</span></span>

Below is not the recommended way to express this
<span class="big center kuwi"><span class="red">mi</span><span class="blue">soweli ala-</span></span>

### Using lon
Similar to what we saw with "tawa" above, "lon" can act as a modifier when occupying the bottom half of a block or as a preposition when occupying the top half, such as in "soweli <span class="blue">lon</span>" (a <span class="blue">real</span> animal):

<span class="kuwi big center">soweli<span class="blue">lon</span></span>

or "...e soweli <span class="green">lon</span> tomo mi" ("an animal <span class="green">in</span> my house")
<span class="kuwi big center">esoweli- <span class="green">lon</span>- tomomi</span>

As seen above, when "lon" acts as a stand alone preposition, it will take <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>, but when "lon" defines the following content word as a location such as "insa" or "poka," that new content word will occupy the bottom half of the lon block. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a noun. Take this sentence as an example: "telo loje li tawa <span class="green">lon</span> <span class="red">insa</span> mi"

<span class="kuwi big center">teloloje litawa- <span class="green">lon</span><span class="red">insa</span> mi-</span> 
("blood is flowing inside me")

<span class="kuwi big center">teloloje litawa- <span class="green">lon</span>- <span class="red">insa</span>mi</span>
("blood is trickling down my guts")(your guts aren't necessarily inside you, they may be on the gound)

### Spacing
Spacing is the final way in which we can create more contrast between concepts and improve legibility within sitelen Kuwi. Because content words, particles, and function words are all easy to distinguish visually, spaces are not exactly necessary:

<span class="kuwi center big">sowelisina  liwilemoku  etelokili  anu  seme-?</span> 

<span class="kuwi center big">sowelisinaliwilemokuetelokilianuseme-?</span>

However, spaces can still be used to group and separate ideas to further mark out connections and boundaries. For example, the sentence "waso suli en soweli lili li moku ala moku e kili jelo jaki?" could be separated like this:

<span class="kuwi big center">wasosuli en sowelilili  limokualamoku-  ekilijelojaki-?</span>
