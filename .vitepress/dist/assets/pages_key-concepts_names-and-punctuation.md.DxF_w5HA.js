This time, however, the top half usually takes a <span class="red">consonant</span> while the bottom usually takes a <span class="blue">vowel</span>. This is what &quot;ma Kanata&quot; would look like:</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">ma-<span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">A</span><span class="red">N</span><span class="blue">A</span><span class="red">T</span><span class="blue">A</span></span></p><p>For syllables that end in -n, the vowel takes a special nasalised form. &quot;jan <span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">an</span>&quot; thus looks like:</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">jan-<span class="red">K</span><span class="blue">AN-</span></span></p><p>If the first syllable of a word is a vowel with no consonant, the vowel will occupy the top half of the glyph and <span class="kuwi medium">-</span> will occupy the bottom half. For example, the &quot;A&quot; in &quot;ma <span class="blue">A</span>sija&quot; has its own block here:</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">ma-<span class="blue">A</span>-sija</span></p><p>If the initial syllable starts with a vowel and ends with an /n/, then the syllable can be written either with a nasalised vowel and <span class="kuwi medium">-</span>, or as a vowel and N glyph. This means &quot;toki <span class="blue">In</span>li&quot; can be written two ways:</p><p><span class="center"><span class="kuwi big">toki-<span class="blue">IN-</span>-LI</span></span><span class="center"><span class="kuwi big">toki-<span class="blue">IN</span>LI</span></span></p><h3 id="punctuation" tabindex="-1">Punctuation <a class="header-anchor" href="#punctuation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Punctuation&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Punctuation is pretty straight forward in sitelen Kuwi. There are only three marks and are written at the end of the sentence as expected: ., ?, !</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">. ? !</span></p><p>If you want to do quotes around a phrase you can use two <span class="kuwi medium">.</span> marks on either side of the quoted phrase. Using this mark as quotes this way is completely optional and more of a stylistic choice. This is how the sentence &quot;ona li toki e ni: mi wile ala e ni&quot; would look with these quotes:</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">ona- litoki- eni- ..mi- wileala eni-..</span></p><p>If the quoted phrase were to end in a ? or !, the final <span class="kuwi medium">.</span> at the end of the quote can be replaced with the appropriate mark. Again, this is a stylistic choice and completely optional, but it&#39;s how I choose to use the script. Here&#39;s an example using &quot;ona li toki e ni: tenpo ni la sina sona a e sitelen Kuwi!&quot;</p><p><span class="kuwi big center">ona- litoki- eni- ..tenponila sinasona a esitelenkuwi.!</span></p>',18)]))}const w=e(o,[["render",i]]);export{d as __pageData,w as default};
